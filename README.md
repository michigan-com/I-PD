# Come help build the media company of the future

####Currently, the Innovation & Product Development team at [Michigan.com](http://www.michigan.com) is seeking:


##Front-End Developer

We need a thought-leader in user experience, information architecture, accessibility and other tenets that make for frictionless, intuitive and habit-forming digital products. The right candidate for this role is not only a master of front-end frameworks, CSS and pre-processors, and javascript libraries for interaction, but can explain to lay people why each is important and the right choice for a given product.


##DevOps Engineer

Our family of consumer digital products served 11.8 million unique users in January. That means code and platforms deployed by the Michigan.com Innovation & Product Development team have to be bulletproof. We’re looking for someone with a passion for infrastructure and performance — because they know it’s critical to the user experience. Maybe you have a systems admin background, hopefully you’ve got experience with automation and deployment, distributed databases, and maybe even chops in data science.


##Full-Stack Javascript Developer

If journalism is to thrive, it must become a two-way street of information between the journalists and the community. If tomorrow’s businesses are to grow, they must engage with prospects and loyal customers in real-time, in personalized ways. To build the tools to do this, the Innovation & Product Development team at Michigan.com is looking for a developer with expert command of asynchronous communication. In other words, we’re looking for a code craftsperson steeped in Javascript and Node.js.
